# Problem

Analyze the data on the basis of given features and develop a model which can accurately determine whether tumors are benign or malignant.



**Benign:** Tumors that are not spread in other parts of the body and do not pose a threat to life so these tumors can be described as non-cancerous.

**Malignant:** Tumors that cause a threat to life and can influence other body parts of tissue so there are high chances that these are the cancer tissues.

# Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer-Dataset

The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset is commonly used for classification tasks, particularly for developing models to classify breast masses as benign or malignant accurately. It serves as a valuable resource for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms and techniques in breast cancer diagnosis.
This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. These features are computed from a digitized image of a biopsy specimen and describe various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The goal is to predict whether a given breast mass is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on these features.

The dataset consists of 569 instances or samples, each with 32 numeric features.

The Algorithms applied to this dataset are given below:

1. Perceptron
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Decision Tree Classifier
4. Naive Bayes
5. Logistic Regression
