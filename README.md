# Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer-Dataset
The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset is commonly used for classification tasks, particularly for developing models to accurately classify breast masses as benign or malignant. It serves as a valuable resource for developing and evaluating machine learning algorithms and techniques in the field of breast cancer diagnosis.

This dataset contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. These features are computed from a digitized image of a biopsy specimen and describe various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The goal is to predict whether a given breast mass is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) based on these features.

The dataset consists of 569 instances or samples, with each sample having 32 numeric features.
